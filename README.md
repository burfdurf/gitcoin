FL Grant


The purpose of this grant is to solicit some metrics on the use of flashloans across chains. For anyone to complete and claim the reward of this job the following requirements must be met:

1 - The bulk $ of all flash loans for ETH/USDC/BTC/DAI on the following chains:
  - Polygon POS, ETH mainnet, Arbitrum 
2 - The Average and median size of flashloans taken for ETH/USDC/BTC/DAI
  - This should be broken down on a per chain basis.
  - Ex: 2000 ETH flashloans were taken  on Polygon POS for June.  The Average size of the loan was x and the median size was y.
3 - Basic charts to visually represent these numbers. The exact types of charts we leave to your best judgement.


Numbers should be sorted by chain, then by token borrowed.
